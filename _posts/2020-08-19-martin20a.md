abstract: The 2019 IARAI traffic4cast competition is a traffic forecasting problem
  based on traffic data from three cities that are encoded as images. We developed
  a ResNet-inspired graph convolutional neural network (GCN) approach that uses street
  network-based subgraphs of the image lattice graphs as a prior. We train the Graph-ResNet
  together with GCN and convolutional neural network (CNN) benchmark models on Moscow
  traffic data and use them to first predict the traffic in Moscow and then to predict
  the traffic in Berlin and Istanbul. The results suggest that the graph-based models
  have superior generalization properties than CNN-based models for this application.
  We argue that in contrast to purely image-based approaches, formulating the prediction
  problem on a graph allows the neural network to learn properties given by the underlying
  street network. This facilitates the transfer of a learned network to predict the
  traffic status at unknown locations.
