abstract: The deployment and evaluation of learning algorithms on autonomous vehicles
  (AV) is expensive, slow, and potentially unsafe. This paper details the F1TENTH
  autonomous racing platform, an open-source evaluation framework for training, testing,
  and evaluating autonomous systems. With 1/10th-scale low-cost hardware and multiple
  virtual environments, F1TENTH enables safe and rapid experimentation of AV algorithms
  even in laboratory research settings. We present three benchmark tasks and baselines
  in the setting of autonomous racing, demonstrating the flexibility and features
  of our evaluation environment.
