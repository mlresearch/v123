title: The Causality for Climate Competition
booktitle: Proceedings of the NeurIPS 2019 Competition and Demonstration Track
year: '2020'
abstract: Understanding the complex interdependencies of processes in our climate
  system has become one of the most critical challenges for society with our main
  current tools being climate modeling and observational data analysis, in particular
  observational causal discovery. Causal discovery is still in its infancy in Earth
  sciences and a major issue is that current methods are not well adapted to climate
  data challenges.  We here present an overview of a NeurIPS 2019 competition on causal
  discovery for climate time series. The Causality 4 Climate (C4C) competition was
  hosted on the benchmark platform {www.causeme.net}. C4C offers an extensive number
  of climate model-based time series datasets with known causal ground truth that
  incorporate the main challenges of causal discovery in climate research. We give
  an overview over the benchmark platform, the challenges modeled, how datasets were
  generated, and implementation details. The goal of C4C is to spur more focused methodological
  research on causal discovery for understanding our climate system.
